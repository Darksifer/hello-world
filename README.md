# hello-world
Hello All,
Am new here learning the ropes. I'm starting out as a full stack web developer,
down the road I would love to get my hands and feet wet learning Java, C++ and Python.
Just recently finished up on a basic intro course to HTML,CSS and just starting Javascript.
As an amatuer musician, wild life and outdoor photographer, I'm hoping to apply to skills to
being a content producer and developing my own social network platform to share with my family
and friends.
